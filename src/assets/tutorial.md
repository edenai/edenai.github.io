With the start from scratch option, you have the flexibility to select your current database provider, your embedding provider from a selection that includes Open AI, Google, Cohere and your LLM model.
In the future, there will be additional choices available, such as adjusting the chunk size, overlap, selecting an OCR provider, and a speech-to-text provider.
